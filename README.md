# my .zshrc-config
my .zshrc config, working on terminator terminal and powerlevel10k

- alias for batcat, lsd and xclip
- unsetopt nomatch -> this way you can concat commands like --script=smb-vuln*
- setopt histignorealldups sharehistory -> to not fill zshrc_history all time
- export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 -> solve problem when opening BurpSuite
- deleted the welcome print we all don't know why is that there
